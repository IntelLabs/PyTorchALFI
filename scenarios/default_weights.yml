# define type of run. Valid values are: {single|accumulate}
# single: at each injection run only the faults for that run are injected
# accumulate: at each injection run the faults for that run and all previous run are applied together
# default: single
run_type: single

# This determines the total number of fault definitions that are prepared
# The relevant parameters are:
# num_runs: number of times you plan to iterate through the whole dataset
# the following 2 arguments are mutually exclusive:
# num_fault_per_image: how many faults should be injected per image
# max_fault_rate: maximum rate of faults you would like to inject -> as floating point number
# this is a max value because you could decide during run time to use a smaller fault rate for a specific
# injection, the maximum value assures that enough faults are prepared
# the absolute number of faults will be determined by the following other parameters:
# a: rnd_mode (either neurons or weights) the number of faults is calculated based on the number of relevant neurons
# or weights respectively in the model
# b: layer_types (either conv2d, conv3d or fcc) relevant neurons or weights are those related to the selected layer type
num_runs: 1000
# you can only set one of num_faults_per_image or max_fault_rate
max_faults_per_image: 1
#max_fault_rate: 0.01

# define if injected faulty values are to be created randomly (one per run)
# or given statically.
# valid values are {random|static}
# In The latter case there need to be as many values
# as num_runs defined.
# default: random

# this section is ignored if value_type = static
# There are 2 basic injection modes: {weights|neurons}
# For NEURONS the parameter for k is ignored. The following degrees of freedom exist: Batches, Layers (out of conv layers),
# location (height + width + channel) of feature map and the value itself.
# for each of these except batch the following options exist: {same|change}
# for batch the following options exist: {each|same|change}
# same: in the first run a random value is calculated once, it remains constant afterwards
# change: in each run a new random value is calculated
# each: (batch only) apply to every batch
# There is a dependency between layers and locations.
# If layers is set to 'change' then location also has to be 'change'
# because layers have different sizes and the same location in a different
# layer might be invalid.
#
# For WEIGHTS the parameter for batch is ignored. The following degrees of freedom exist: Layers (out of conv layers),
# location (height + width + channel + k)  and the value itself
# a setting for batch is ignored in context of weight injection
# default: neurons
# rnd_mode: neurons
rnd_mode: weights

# mandatory, no defaults
# batch only used for neuron
rnd_batch: change
# rnd_layer allows to set the index of the layer where all fault injections occur
# this is a 0 based index: e.g. for first layer set it to 0
# this is currently only relevant for convolutional layers
# rnd_layer and rnd_location should be changed to same setting
# layer change and location same does not make sense beause layer dimensions differ
rnd_layer: change
# select layer randomly based on the number of neurons per layer, layer with more neurons are weighted higher
rnd_layer_weighted: True
rnd_location: change
rnd_value: change

# For the value itself there are 2 options: {number|bitflip}
# in the first case a min-max range needs to be given
# in the second case the maximum bit position and optionally
# a bit range is given which can also be a single number
# both cases are mutual exclusive
